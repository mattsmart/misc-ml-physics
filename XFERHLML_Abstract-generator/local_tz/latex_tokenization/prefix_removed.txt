Electron
temperature
anisotropies
and
electron
beams
are
nonthermal
features
of
the
observed
nonequilibrium
electron
velocity
distributions
in
the
solar
wind
.
In
collision
-
poor
plasmas
these
nonequilibrium
distributions
are
expected
to
be
regulated
by
kinetic
instabilities
through
wave
-
particle
interactions
.
This
study
considers
electron
instabilities
driven
by
the
interplay
of
core
electron
temperature
anisotropies
and
the
electron
b
eam
,
and
firstly
gives
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
instabilities
in
arbitrary
directions
to
the
background
magnetic
field
.
It
clarifies
the
dominant
parameter
regime
(
e.g.
,
parallel
core
electron
plasma
beta
$
\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$
,
core
electron
temperature
anisotropy
$A_{\mathrm{ec}}\equiv
T
_{\mathrm{ec\perp}}/T_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$
,
and
electron
beam
velocity
$
V_{\mathrm{eb}}$
)
for
each
kind
of
electron
instability
(
e.g.
,
the
electron
beam
-
driven
electron
acoustic
/
magnetoacoustic
i
nstability
,
the
electron
beam
-
driven
whistler
i
nstability
,
the
electromagnetic
electron
cyclotron
i
nstability
,
the
electron
mirror
i
nstability
,
the
electron
firehose
i
nstability
,
and
the
ordinary
-
mode
i
nstability
)
.
It
finds
that
the
electron
beam
can
destabilize
electron
acoustic
/
magnetoacoustic
waves
in
the
low-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$
r
egime
,
and
whistler
waves
in
the
medium-
and
large-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$
regime
.
It
also
finds
that
a
new
oblique
fast
-
magnetosonic
/
whistler
instability
is
driven
by
the
electron
beam
with
$V_{\mathrm{eb}}\gtrsim7V_{\mathrm{A}}$
in
a
regime
where
$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}\sim0.1
-
2
$
and
$A_{\mathrm{ec}}<1$.
M
oreover
,
this
study
presents
electromagnetic
responses
of
each
kind
of
electron
instability
.
These
results
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
for
electron
instability
constraints
on
core
electron
temperature
anisotropies
and
electron
beams
in
the
solar
wind
.
